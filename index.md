<p>
Hello! My name is Ana and I’m a biomedical engineering student currently studying at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), University of Lisbon. I am interested in areas where computing meets biology thus having developed my master's thesis in computational neuroscience.
</p>

<p>I love to learn and face new challenges since I am a very curious person. As an engineering graduate, I’ve acquired several skills throughout my progress, such as being proactive, organized, determined, and motivated to do a project even when faced with a conundrum. Besides, I consider myself a creative person that loves to brainstorm and discuss new ideas.</p>

<p>That being said, I aspire to make a difference in people’s lives by using technology and applying it to the healthcare field.</p>

<h2> Skills</h2>

# **Biography**

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D student in the [College of Artificial Intelligence](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm) from March 2018, advised by Prof. [Yihong Gong](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/ygong). Prior to that, I received the B.E. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2016. My research interests include computer vision and pattern recognition, especially in the areas of object tracking, transfer learning and multi-modal learning. [[CV]](assets/file/CV.pdf)
